# Lienzo Vivo

## Project Overview
**Lienzo Vivo** is an Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to enhance the art purchasing experience. The app allows users to scan their spaces and preview how paintings of different sizes, frames, and styles will look in real-time. This ensures a more confident and informed decision when purchasing artwork.

## Key Features
- **AR Visualization**: Scan your space and place paintings virtually on walls.  
- **Size & Scale Control**: Adjust the painting to different sizes, ensuring proper scaling and fit.  
- **Frame & Style Customization**: Choose from various frames and artistic styles.  
- **Multi-Painting Placement**: Add and move multiple paintings simultaneously.  
- **Realistic Interaction**: Place paintings behind or in front of objects for higher accuracy.  
- **Modern Trends Integration**: Access updated catalogs with trending frames and artwork.  

## Usability Focus
This project was developed under Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, prioritizing:  
- **Simplicity**: Minimal steps to visualize and customize a painting.  
- **Accessibility**: Easy navigation for different user profiles.  
- **Engagement**: An intuitive interface that promotes exploration and creativity.  

## Project Scope
The culmination of this project consists of:  
- **Interactive Mockups**: Designed in Figma to simulate core interactions.  
- **Usability Testing**: Evaluating how users interact with the app prototype.  
- **Design Challenges**: Addressing scaling, placement accuracy, and realistic visualization.  

## Future Opportunities
Based on current AR and app trends, potential improvements include:  
- Enhanced app stability and performance.  
- Dynamic updates of art collections and styles.  
- Simplified subscription and payment models.  
- Advanced user customization for personalized experiences.
