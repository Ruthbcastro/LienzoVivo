# Project Definition – Lienzo Vivo

## Problem
Users who wish to visualize art in their interior spaces face difficulties in understanding how artworks will look in real environments before purchasing. Existing applications like Artrooms, WallPicture, Smartist, Art.com, and ART AR show recurring issues, including crashes, limited frame manipulation, lack of realistic rendering, outdated styles, and confusing subscription models. These limitations hinder users from making informed decisions about size, placement, and style, reducing satisfaction and causing frustration. Additionally, most apps lack intuitive interfaces and customization tools, which makes the process of visualizing art cumbersome and inefficient.

## Causes
The main causes of these problems are:
1. **Limited technological capabilities:** Many apps do not offer stable AR visualization, realistic rendering, or advanced object manipulation.
2. **Lack of personalization:** Users cannot freely move, scale, or overlap multiple artworks, limiting creative exploration.
3. **Outdated content:** Frames, environments, and styles are often old-fashioned or too few to match current interior design trends.
4. **Subscription and access barriers:** Confusing pricing and paywalls prevent users from accessing full functionalities.
5. **Poor user experience:** Non-intuitive interfaces reduce usability and increase the likelihood of errors or dissatisfaction.

## Goal
To develop a mobile application, **Lienzo Vivo**, that allows users to visualize, customize, and preview artworks in their interior spaces using augmented reality. The app will provide:
- Full control over artwork placement, scaling, and layering.
- Updated frames, styles, and interior backgrounds according to modern trends.
- Intuitive and fast interface for effortless use.
- Clear subscription and pricing options.
- Tools for personalization, project saving, and sharing.

## Social Relevance
This project is socially relevant as it supports art appreciation, encourages the acquisition of meaningful artworks, and promotes interior creativity. By offering a tool that reduces uncertainty in artwork selection, users can make more confident purchases and create spaces that reflect personal taste. It also supports emerging artists by facilitating the promotion of local and sustainable artworks, enhancing cultural engagement and economic opportunities.

## Innovation
**Lienzo Vivo** differentiates itself by combining:
- Realistic AR visualization with interactive features.
- Full artwork manipulation (move, scale, layer, frame thickness adjustment).
- Integration of current art and interior design trends (soft minimalism, brutalism modern, industrial 2.0).
- Personalization and project management (save configurations, share images).
- Accessibility, intuitive design, and smooth user experience.

## Feasibility
The project is feasible given the increasing demand for AR visualization tools among art enthusiasts and interior design users. Preliminary research on similar apps shows clear pain points that **Lienzo Vivo** can address. The development team possesses the technical skills to implement AR visualization, object manipulation, and UI/UX design. Subscription models and user-focused design ensure adoption and engagement.

## Objective
The main objective of this app is to allow users to visualize and customize artworks in their interior spaces using augmented reality, providing intuitive tools to adjust size, proportion, placement, and style of the artworks, facilitating purchase decisions and enhancing the design and decoration experience.

## Potential Users
- Art enthusiasts and collectors seeking to preview artworks in their own interiors.
- Interior design professionals or hobbyists wanting to plan décor around artworks.
- Users interested in AR experiences to test spatial placement, frame styles, and proportions.
- Buyers seeking personalized, informed, and confident art purchasing experiences.
