# Research on Art and Interior Design Trends 2025 and Application Implications

To define the objective of our augmented reality app for artwork, we reviewed the main trends in art, design, and decoration identified by experts for 2025, combining information from specialized blogs (Puri Ramón & Sutton Anders, 2024; Jarauta Romero, 2024), Humanitas Educación (2025), and Revista Interiores (2024). These trends help understand what users are looking for and how our app can offer innovative and interactive experiences.

## Art Trends 2025 and App Applications

### Oversized Artworks

Large-scale artworks create visual impact and allow users to explore new perspectives, even in small spaces (Puri Ramón & Sutton Anders, 2024).

**App Application:** Enable users to visualize large paintings or sculptures in their space, with tools to adjust scale and view the realistic effect in their room.

### Digital Art, Virtual, Augmented, and Artificial Intelligence

AI allows generating artworks that challenge traditional authorship, while VR, AR, and MR provide immersive and interactive experiences (Jarauta Romero, 2024).

**App Application:** Implement AR experiences that simulate movement, emotions, and interactive styles of artworks. Include intelligent suggestions of pieces according to the user's space and preferred style.

### Sustainable and Biophilic Art

Sustainability using recycled materials and environmental awareness is increasingly important. Biophilic art incorporates natural elements to foster connection with the environment (Revista Interiores, 2024).

**App Application:** Enable visualization of artworks in biophilic environments. Allow users to see how art interacts with natural elements and promote sustainable artists.

### Rise of Textiles and Innovative Materials

Techniques such as weaving, felt, embroidery, and unexpected materials are reinterpreted with a modern approach (Humanitas Educación, 2025).

**App Application:** Simulate how artworks interact with textures and materials in the room, providing realistic previews of combined textures.

### Meaningful and Personalized Art

Buyers seek art that connects with their emotions, values, and personal stories (Puri Ramón & Sutton Anders, 2024).

**App Application:** Offer personalized recommendations according to style, narrative, and the emotions the user wants to convey.

### Fusion of Disciplines and Social Movements

Technology and social themes shape the contemporary art landscape (Jarauta Romero, 2024).

**App Application:** Include works from emerging artists and diverse cultures, with interactive themes reflecting current social topics.

### Folk Art and Popular Art

There is a resurgence of art celebrating local traditions and cultural narratives (Revista Interiores, 2024).

**App Application:** Enable exploration and acquisition of artworks from local artists that provide authenticity and cultural storytelling.

## Interior Design Trends 2025 and App Applications

### Modern Brutalism

Use of concrete, steel, glass, and wood with intentional material exposure. Prioritizes authenticity, functionality, and #nowaste aesthetics (Humanitas Educación, 2025).

**App Application:** Display artworks integrated with raw materials and geometric structures, allowing users to see how art fits in a brutalist environment.

### Soft Minimalism

Warm minimalism focuses on simplicity, warmth, and connection with nature. Uses wood, neutral palettes, and natural textures (Revista Interiores, 2024).

**App Application:** Enable users to visualize artworks in minimalist spaces with a tactile and cozy approach.

### Industry 2.0

Modern industrial style with cold, desaturated palettes; urban sophistication and resilient materials. Uses metallic boards combined with wood for durability and aesthetics (Jarauta Romero, 2024).

**App Application:** Simulate artworks in industrial and modern materials to assess aesthetic fit and cohesion.

## Conclusion: Implications for the App

Developing an app for artwork visualization in interior spaces must prioritize interactivity, personalization, and context-aware representation. The app should:

- Allow experimentation with **scale and proportion**, particularly for large artworks.
- Simulate realistic interactions of artworks with **textures, materials, and environmental elements**.
- Integrate AR, VR, and AI-generated content to enhance **immersive experiences**.
- Reflect **current interior design trends**, such as soft minimalism, modern brutalism, or Industry 2.0.
- Offer **personalization features**, including project creation, saving, exporting, and sharing.
- Provide educational content and recommendations about trends, artists, and compositions.
- Encourage users to **evaluate art in context**, considering scale, proportion, and interaction with surrounding elements for optimal visual and aesthetic impact.

By combining art, technology, sustainability, and interior design, the app can deliver a **complete and modern user experience** adapted to contemporary needs.
