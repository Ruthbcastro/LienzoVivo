## Background
Emily works as an interior designer for residential clients. She often needs to visualize how artworks, furniture, and decorations will look in client spaces before making purchases. She is detail-oriented, creative, and values tools that save time and reduce guesswork.  

---

## Goals
- Quickly visualize artworks in real spaces without physically moving items.  
- Customize artworks (size, frame, position) to match client interiors.  
- Save and share AR visualizations with clients for approvals.  
- Discover new art pieces aligned with client preferences.  

---

## Frustrations / Pain Points
- AR apps that are slow or laggy frustrate her workflow.  
- Complex interfaces with hidden gestures or unintuitive controls.  
- Apps that don’t allow multiple artworks to be placed and compared together.  
- Difficulty in sharing AR visualizations directly with clients.  

---

## Motivations
- Deliver high-quality interior design proposals efficiently.  
- Experiment with different art styles and combinations without risk.  
- Impress clients with interactive and realistic visualizations.  

---

## Behaviors
- Frequently switches between tablet and phone for work tasks.  
- Prefers clear, visible controls rather than menus hidden in gestures.  
- Enjoys trying new apps but abandons them if the interface is confusing.  
- Likes to save multiple project versions for comparison.

## Scenario of Use
Emily receives a new client project. She opens the AR Art app on her tablet, browses the catalog, selects her client’s favorite pieces, and positions them in the room using AR. She adjusts sizes, rotates artworks, and adds frames. Once satisfied, she saves the project and shares a video preview with her client for feedback.
